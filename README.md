By running the following command in root folder of the project, 
a _um_ folder with views will be copied over to _resources/views_ folder 

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish
```

Developers are suggested to create their own layouts and extend the layouts in the view.

```sh
um
|---user
|----|---index.blade.php
|----|---create.blade.php
|----|---edit.blade.php
|----|---show.blade.php
|---group
|----|---index.blade.php
|----|---create.blade.php
|----|---edit.blade.php
|----|---show.blade.php
|---role
|----|---index.blade.php
|----|---create.blade.php
|----|---edit.blade.php
|----|---show.blade.php
|---permission
|----|---index.blade.php
|----|---create.blade.php
|----|---edit.blade.php
|----|---show.blade.php
```
---

<a name="view-layout"></a>12.View Layout 

The views described in [11](#vendor-publish-view) do NOT include any CSS nor JS resources.

Therefore, a layout with required front-end resources is essential in order to use the default views.
modify the view to extend the layout you have created.

The required front-end resources will be specified in [13](#front-end-resources)

layout:

```blade
<link href="the_required_css_styles" />
<script src="the_required_js"></script>
```

views generated by vendor:publish

```blade
@extends('the_layout_you_have_created')

{{--default view content--}}
......
...
.
```

---

<a name="front-end-resources"></a>13.Required Front-end Resources 

The default views of UM package required a few front-end resources.
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* DataTables
* Select2

> If your project does not have the resource specified above ready, please proceed with the following installation.
> 
> ```sh
> #install jQuery
> $ npm install jquery
> #install Bootstrap 3 
> $ npm install bootstrap@3
> #install DataTables
> $ npm install datatables.net
> #install DataTables Bootstrap theme
> $ npm install datatables.net-bs
> #install Select2

###<a name="controllers"></a>Controllers 

There are two sets of controllers:

1. The controllers inside UM package.

2. The controllers generate by UM package and sit in _app\Http\Controllers\UM_ folder.

#####<a name="controllers-in-um-package"></a>Controllers in _UM_ package 

The controllers mainly provide functions of CRUD of _user_, _group_, _role_ and _permission_.

The `index` function of the controllers takes a parameter to indicate the expected output format: `"datatable"` or `null`. 
`"datatable"` takes corresponding request values and filters the result accordingly.
While `null` value outputs all records of the entities.

> All functions in controllers in _UM_ package do not deal with views nor routes.
>
> In order to provide good enough flexibility to this package, 
> data validations of `create` and `update` functions are in Controllers in _app_ folder.

#####<a name="controllers-in-app-folder"></a>Controllers in _app_ folder 

The controllers in _app_ folder take care of the _routes_, _views_ and _representation of data_.

By default, the controllers are pointing to the views in _resources/views/um_. 
However, this can be changed directly in the controllers in _app_ folder.

---
###<a name="middleware"></a>Middleware 

There are three main types of middleware available in the package.

* role
* permission
* ability (used only in a complicated situation)


All middleware can be set in _routes_ file or _controllers_. And here are the usages.

#####<a name="sample-usage-of-role-in-routes"></a>Sample usage of role in _routes_: 

```php
Route::get('url', ['middleware' => ['role:super_admin|client']])
```

> `super_admin` and `client` are the _name_ of roles (NOT _display_name_)
>
> In this case, only the users with role `super_admin` OR `client` can access this route.
> 

#####<a name="sample-usage-of-permission-in-routes"></a>Sample usage of permission in _routes_: 

```php
Route::get('url', ['middleware' => ['permission:create_user|edit_user']])
```

> `create_user` and `edit_user` are the _name_ of permissions (NOT _display_name_)
> 
> This route only open to the users with permission of `create_user` OR `edit_user`.

#####<a name="sample-usage-of-ability-in-routes"></a>Sample usage of ability in _routes_: 

```php
Route::get('url', ['middleware' => ['ability:super_admin|client,create_user|edit_user', true]])
```

> This middleware takes three (3) parameters, including _roles_, _permissions_ and _operator_.
>
> Operator is a boolean (true/false) indicating if middleware needs to validate both roles and permissions or not.
>
> In this case, the route only open to the `super_admin` OR `client` with the permissions of `create_user` OR `edit|user`.

#####<a name="sample-usage-of-middleware-in-controllers"></a>Sample usage of middleware in _controllers_: 

```php
$this->middleware('role:super_admin, ['only' => ['create', 'store']]');
$this->middleware('permission:create_user', ['only' => ['create', 'store']]);
$this->middleware('ability:super_admin,create_user,true', ['only' => ['create', 'store']]);
```

> Syntax is pretty much same as middleware in route. 
> However, we need to indicate which functions the middleware shall be applied to by having
> `['only' => [blah blah blah]` as the second parameter in the middleware functions.

###<a name="default-data"></a>Default Data
